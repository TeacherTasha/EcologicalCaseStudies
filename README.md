# EcologicalCaseStudies
Ecology, the study of our home, is diverse field of biology that spans from the level of the individual to that of the biosphere. Students interested in pursuing a career in the natural sciences need to learn the basic theories and concepts underlying ecology. How and why do species evolve over time? What fitness trade-offs govern animal behavior? How do individuals within and across species interact? How does disturbance influence how an ecosystem functions?     

Equally important, however, is for students to learn the process of doing science. This process includes the ability to think critically, form testable hypotheses, and communicate results to technical and non-technical audiences. Conducting research also requires skills in manipulating, analyzing, and visualizing complex datasets using reproducible workflows. Working with real data can enhance student learning and engagement in the natural sciences and help them to build these necessary skills (Langen et al. 2014, Oâ€™Reilly et al. 2017). In the field of ecology, most research relies on the open-source statistical program R for data analysis. Graduate programs and jobs increasingly require experience with this programming language (Auker and Barthelmess 2020). To prepare their students for graduation, ecology educators should consider integrating R into their courses.

Finding relevant, interesting datasets and developing R lesson plans can be a time consuming task, particularly for educators with little prior experience in this program. To help reduce the barriers to teaching R in undergraduate courses, we are curating this a repository and book of ecological case studies with associated R code. These studies represent the final project in ES 211 (Principles of Ecology) at Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania, USA; students are tasked with finding an open ecological dataset of interest, developing a hypothesis, exploring data and testing their hypothesis in R, and communicating their findings in a variety of formats. Students are given the option to publish their work as part of this case studies collection. This course is taught annually, so new case studies will be added each year.

In this repository, you will find R Notebooks and data linked to case studies that span the discipline of Ecology. The copyright on this book is CC BY-SA 4.0, so the materials can be edited and remixed to fit your needs as an educator or a learner. All of the case studies involved make use of publicly available datasets.

The code associated with each case study recreates the analyses and figures presented in that case study. We do not claim that the statistical approaches used are fully appropriate; many students entering this course have limited statistical background, and the course only covers basic descriptive and inferential statistics. We can think of many ways that educators could use this code as a starting point to build on in their classes. For example: 

  Sections of code can be deleted, or errors can be inserted, and students can be asked to write or correct code. 
  Students can be asked to test the assumptions of the statistical tests used in the analyses and/or come up with more appropriate tests. 
  Students can be tasked with improving data visualization by changing graph types or adding additional ggplot commands. 
  For many of the datasets involved, additional hypotheses could be formed and tested by students.

We hope you find our resource helpful and welcome your feedback for improving it!
